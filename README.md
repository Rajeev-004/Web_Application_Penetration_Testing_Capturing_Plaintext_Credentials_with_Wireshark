# Web_Application_Penetration_Testing_Capturing_Plaintext_Credentials_with_Wireshark
This project demonstrates how login credentials can be intercepted using Wireshark from an insecure web application. By capturing HTTP traffic on "testphp.vulnweb.com", we show how usernames and passwords are transmitted in plaintext, highlighting the risks of HTTP and the need for HTTPS encryption.
